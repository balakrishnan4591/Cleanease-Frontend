## Installation

To run this app locally - follow the below steps.

- Download all three repositories(Cleanease-Backend, Cleanease-Frontend, Cleanease-Admin)
- Install dependencies using npm install
- Start the development server with "npm run dev"(for Frontend, and Admin projects), "npm run server"(for backend project)
- Using postman test the API endpoints(if you face any issues accessing the Render deployment URL then you can use "http://localhost:5173/"(for frontend), "http://localhost:5174/"(for admin portal) instead of render deployment URL). And the following code change is required in backend's .env file(FRONTEND_URL = "http://localhost:5173"), admin's assets.js file(export const url = 'http://localhost:4000') and in the frontend's StoreContext.jsx file update the url as "http://localhost:4000".
